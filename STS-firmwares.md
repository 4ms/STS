# Stereo Triggered Sampler - Firmwares

### How do I know what version I have?
Two ways:
1) Put your microSD card into your computer. Open up the `__Sample List__.html` file. At the top it will say "Firmware version XXX".

2) Go into System Mode (check the manual if don't know how!). Press and hold the Edit button. The colors of the Reverse buttons tell you the version number:

Left Reverse		| 		Right Reverse:

`Orange | Orange ==> 1.0

White | White ==> 1.1

White | Red ==> 1.2

`
